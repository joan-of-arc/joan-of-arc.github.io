        Born in the previous generation in Bohai City, Fu Hua's hometown was destroyed by Honkai impacts. She was the only survivor. Captain Himeko of Squad V in Fire Moth, who was scouting for new members in the remains of the Honkai impact, invited Fu Hua into the Fire Moth, teaching her how to fight under the codename MSA-209 HUA in Squad V.

        Unfortunately, Captain Himeko became the 8th Herrscher of Fire, causing the death of everyone in Squad V except Fu Hua; leaving her to be shunned by other Moth members and even gaining the nickname 'Firewytch's little birdie'.

        A year after Himeko became a Herrscher, Fire Moth tested the 10th God Key in Australia. The project, led by Dr. MEI, aimed to test a drug that might be able to achieve mass production of fusion warriors whose skills would exceed that of average humans and have enough power to beat a Herrscher. Without telling the participants about the experiment, all participating fighters (normal people without the ability to fight using Honkai energy), including Fu Hua, were injected with a special drug containing Factor Meta-Morph, and were equipped with the mass produced 10th God Keys (inactivated). 

        But what appeared in front of them was the emperor-level Honkai beast, Ganesha, and the inactivated 10th God Keys were useless against it as almost all the warriors could not activate the God Key. This led to the death of most of the soldiers. Fu Hua, who had been severely weakened, could no longer escape the battle, nor could she do anything to protect herself, as her 10th God Key had been broken. Although the Honkai energy emitted by Ganesha alone was more than enough to destroy her, Fu Hua refused to die out of determination to live on, and Fu Hua's will awakened the Factor Meta-Morph, leading to the successful fusion of the DNA conjugated with the compound in the drug with her own, becoming another fusion warrior after Kevin.

        Fu Hua's eyes turned red, and her hair turned white. She attained a pair of wings (the Original Wings), which were quite similar to Benares' on her back. Her broken God Key was activated after detection of Factor Meta-Morph and reconstructed to be the Grips of Tai Xuan. She flew in the sky and looked down at Ganesha, and destroyed the Honkai Beast in one hit.

        Ever since, Fu Hua's body has been unable to age, forever stuck in the body of a 17 year old. In order for her body to adapt to a the stats of a grown-up, Fu Hua took the SWARA treatment. It is still unknown what the SWARA treatment is.

        Dr. MEI, one of the greatest scientists of that time, left a batch of girls with special stigmata on the eve of the destruction of mankind and called it “the seeds of revenge against Honkai”. Fu Hua was one of them. 

        I HECKING LOVE FU HUA
